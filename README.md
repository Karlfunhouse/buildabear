## Getting Started

This is a single-page application that runs directly from the index.html file. Either clone down the repo and run the index file, or you can simply use the application via [GitHub Pages here](https://karlfunhouse.github.io/buildabear/).

## Project Goals

* Write clean, DRY, and performant code that utlizes SOLID and object-oriented principles
* Create a clear, aesthetically pleasing, and accessible UI that encourages user interactivity 
* Write code that can be easily read and understood by other developers

## Challenges

* Connecting the data model directly to the DOM, instead of treating the two models as separate entities
* Encapsulating and abstracting processes into methods and interface/helper functions 
* Creating application stability/flexibility to scale and expand

## Wins

* Using classes and creating objects in a systematic approach, which ultimately supports code readability and application scalability
* Creating a simple-yet-pleasing UI that utilizes subtle animations, usability optimizations, and considerate design decisions to reinforce user behavior

## Built With

* Vanilla HTML/CSS
* Vanilla JS
