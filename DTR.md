#### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Lane - pair programming bounce things off of each other

Lane - mediator, find the balance that works for everyone and maximize group efficiency.  Not necessarily going to take the lead but can support others or be solo  
Karl - work as a team, making sure i understand the concepts and going slow if there's confusion.  Asking for help when needed.  
Ryan - very organized and process driven. Consistency and order with planning out how we will do the project so when we get to grading we've stayed within our agreements the whole project.

Conflicting communication styles and partners being unaware of their impact.    
Lack of Poms.

#### How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Everyone is on the same page before moving forward.  Everyone reviews code.  Everyone gets to be heard and group will deliberate as to proper course of action based on situation.  

---

#### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
No distractions work environment - Turing or conference room or otherwise private and focused environment.    
Clear communication in PRs and making comments to clarify code before it gets merged.    
Keep project related conversations documented digitally for reference.    

---

#### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
School day work days til 630-7  
Outside school days stick to later in the day work blocks (after noon-6 or whatever chunk feels appropriate based on daily goals)  

---

#### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Clear direct authentic honest actionable.  Feedback is sometimes hard to give if unsure how person will take it.   

--- 

#### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
Karl - html & css.  Reasonable grasp on javascript but still struggle populating something from nothing.  Strong in design and how things should look for feel good ux.  
Lane - html & css.  Comfortable with javascript but still need reps in certain areas.  Strong in UI and animations.  Maybe let's make the bear dance?  
Ryan - html & css.  Strong UX sensability and how things should feel and work.  Want to expand on sense of design with font compatability and color palates.

#### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Karl - I like to struggle to a reasonable degree before getting tips.    
Ryan - Depends on scope of problem.  If all are challenged meet as a group to solve it together.  If there are smaller issues that one member needs help also just using group as resource.  
Lane - Agrees with above.  

---

#### How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Karl - Learning to implement new concepts in a way that are understandable after the project is done.  
Lazer Bear Boyz for Lyfe, Yo!  
Ryan - Having a shared understanding as a group as to what we created and how it works.  No one's left behind or out of the learning that's intended to take place over the course of the project.  Establishing skills that can be transferrable to future projects.    
Lane - Communication habits are clear throughout.  Establishing a fluid work flow that keeps everyone productive and challenged.  

---

#### How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
Call them when we see them.    
High fives and positive feedback on PRs and code that's been submitted to merge to master.    
Identify wins that will also translate to future projects.   
We want to make sure everyone understands the content, has an understanding of the code, have a well thought out plan of attack and execute it step by step in order.  Resulting in a working app that has a few extra extentions would also be a win.

#### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
We were pretty thorough with this in the questions above.  

---

#### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
Coming together to have 3 perspectives as to how we could approach a problem together.

---

#### What do you need to look out for, in terms of strengths/working styles coming into conflict?
Clearly and overly communicate to avoid conflicts before they happen is our approach.

---

#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
After school, on weekends when it makes sense.
